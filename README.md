# Session and kill zones

## Forex Trading Session

A forex trading session refers to one of the four main periods during the 24-hour forex market when trading activity is concentrated. These sessions are named after major financial centers: Sydney, Tokyo, London, and New York. Each session has distinct characteristics in terms of volatility and trading volume, and they open and close sequentially, allowing continuous trading around the clock.

## Kill Zone

A kill zone in forex trading is a specific, shorter time window within these broader trading sessions characterized by heightened volatility and increased trading volume. Kill zones typically occur around the opening hours of major sessions, such as the London and New York sessions, and are considered prime opportunities for traders to capitalize on significant price movements.

## UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)

Is the primary global time standard used to regulate clocks and time worldwide. It serves as the reference point from which all other time zones are defined. UTC is based on highly precise atomic clocks combined with measurements of the Earth's rotation, making it more accurate than the older Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) standard.
